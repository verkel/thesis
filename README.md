# Virtual tutor for dance games
**Designing and implementation of procedural animation and artificial intelligence**

Aalto University Master's Thesis

## Abstract

Dance games are a type of rhythm games, in which the player steps on buttons on a dance pad, following the beat of a song. In these games, the learning curve for the novice player can be steep, because they rarely offer any explanation of how the player should actually move on the dance pad. Even for the experienced player, interpretation of patterns in the harder songs can be tricky.
 
In this master's thesis, we describe the design and implementation of an animated tutor character for dance games. The character will dance to a particular song in the game, demonstrating how the step patterns for the song are played. A person playing the game can then learn to perform the song by following the demonstration.
 
The dancer character is animated with procedural animation techniques, including inverse kinematics and PID control. Additionally, we describe an artificial intelligence for dance games, which drives the moves of the dancer.
